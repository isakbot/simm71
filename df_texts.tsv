3D worlds from a single image. This lets you step into any image and explore it in 3D. 
Beyond the input image, all is generated:

3D World 
Most GenAI tools make 2D content like images or videos. Generating in 3D instead improves 
control and consistency. This will change how we make movies, games, simulators, and other 
digital manifestations of our physical world. 
In this post you'll explore our generated worlds, rendered live in your browser. You'll also 
experience different camera effects, 3D effects, and dive into classic paintings. Finally, you'll 
see how creators are already building with our models.

3D Effects 
Most generative models predict pixels. Predicting a 3D scene instead has many benefits: 
•  Persistent Reality: Once a world is generated, it's there to stay. The scene won't 

change behind your back if you look away and come back. 

•  Real-Time Control: After generating a scene, you can move around it in real-time. 
You can linger on the details of a flower, or peek around a corner to see what is 
revealed. 

•  Correct Geometry: Our generated worlds obey basic physical rules of 3D geometry. 
They have a sense of solidity and depth that contrasts with the dream-like nature of 
some AI-generated video. 

The simplest way to visualize the 3D scene is a depth map where each pixel is colored by its 
distance to the camera:

Creative Workflows 
3D world generation naturally composes with other AI tools. This allows creators to work 
with tools they already know to enable new experiences. 
For example, we can create worlds from text by first generating an image using a text-to-
image model. Different models have their own style which our worlds can inherit. 
Here we generate four variants of the same scene using different text-to-image models,[4] all 
using the same prompt: 
A vibrant cartoon-style teenager's bedroom with a bed covered in colorful blankets, a 
cluttered desk with a computer, posters on the walls, and scattered sports gear. A guitar 
leans against the wall, and a cozy, patterned rug is in the center. Light from a window adds a 
warm, youthful vibe to the room.

characters within scenes and direct precise camera movements:

These results are our first early preview of generating 3D worlds. We are hard at work 
improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways 
for users to interact with them.

Pika AI: Pika 1.5 [Future of AI Video Generation]

Pika 1.5 is designed to streamline the video creation process, making it possible to generate impressive content with minimal technical knowledge. Here’s how it works:

Text-to-Video Generation: Pika 1.5 allows users to create videos by entering simple text prompts. For example, you can type a prompt like ""A warrior in armor standing on a
battleﬁeld,"" and the AI will generate a video based on that description. This feature makes it easy for users to visualize ideas quickly, without needing extensive video editing
skills.
Application of Pikaffects: Once the base video is generated, users can apply Pikaffects to enhance the visual elements of the video. For example, you can make an object in
the video inﬂate, melt, explode, or transform into a cake. These effects can be easily applied with just a few clicks, giving users the freedom to be as imaginative as they want.
Cinematic Camera Controls: Pika 1.5 includes advanced camera control techniques like Bullet Time and Crane Down, allowing users to simulate complex camera
movements that were previously only possible with professional gear. These movements add depth and cinematic ﬂair to the videos, helping creators tell their stories in more
engaging ways.
Improved Realism and Animation: The improvements in realism are evident in the ﬂuidity and lifelike quality of the animations. Characters and objects now move more

Video generation models as world simulators

February 15, 2024

View Sora overview

We explore large-scale training of generative models on video data. Specifically, we train text-conditional diffusion models jointly
on videos and images of variable durations, resolutions and aspect ratios. We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on

spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity

video. Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators

of the physical world.

This technical report focuses on (1) our method for turning visual data of all types into a unified representation that enables large-

scale training of generative models, and (2) qualitative evaluation of Sora’s capabilities and limitations. Model and implementation

details are not included in this report.

Much prior work has studied generative modeling of video data using a variety of methods, including recurrent networks,

1, 2, 3

generative adversarial networks,

4, 5, 6, 7

 autoregressive transformers,

8, 9

 and diffusion models.

10, 11, 12

 These works often focus on a

narrow category of visual data, on shorter videos, or on videos of a fixed size. Sora is a generalist model of visual data—it can

generate videos and images spanning diverse durations, aspect ratios and resolutions, up to a full minute of high definition video.

Turning visual data into patches

 The
We take inspiration from large language models which acquire generalist capabilities by training on internet-scale data.
success of the LLM paradigm is enabled in part by the use of tokens that elegantly unify diverse modalities of text—code, math

13, 14

and various natural languages. In this work, we consider how generative models of visual data can inherit such benefits. Whereas

LLMs have text tokens, Sora has visual patches. Patches have previously been shown to be an effective representation for models

of visual data.

15, 16, 17, 18

 We find that patches are a highly-scalable and effective representation for training generative models on

diverse types of videos and images.

At a high level, we turn videos into patches by first compressing videos into a lower-dimensional latent space,

19

 and subsequently

decomposing the representation into spacetime patches.

compressed latent space. We also train a corresponding decoder model that maps generated latents back to pixel space.

Spacetime latent patches

Given a compressed input video, we extract a sequence of spacetime patches which act as transformer tokens. This scheme works

for images too since images are just videos with a single frame. Our patch-based representation enables Sora to train on videos

and images of variable resolutions, durations and aspect ratios. At inference time, we can control the size of generated videos by
arranging randomly-initialized patches in an appropriately-sized grid.

Scaling transformers for video generation

Sora is a diffusion model

; given input noisy patches (and conditioning information like text prompts), it’s trained to

predict the original “clean” patches. Importantly, Sora is a diffusion transformer.

26

 Transformers have demonstrated remarkable

scaling properties across a variety of domains, including language modeling,

 computer vision,

15, 16, 17, 18

 and image generation.

In this work, we find that diffusion transformers scale effectively as video models as well. Below, we show a comparison of video

samples with fixed seeds and inputs as training progresses. Sample quality improves markedly as training compute increases.

Variable durations, resolutions, aspect ratios

Past approaches to image and video generation typically resize, crop or trim videos to a standard size—e.g., 4 second videos at
256×256 resolution. We find that instead training on data at its native size provides several benefits.

Sampling flexibility

Sora can sample widescreen 1920×1080p videos, vertical 1080×1920 videos and everything inbetween. This lets Sora create
content for different devices directly at their native aspect ratios. It also lets us quickly prototype content at lower sizes before
generating at full resolution—all with the same model.

Improved framing and composition

We empirically find that training on videos at their native aspect ratios improves composition and framing. We compare Sora

against a version of our model that crops all training videos to be square, which is common practice when training generative
models. The model trained on square crops (left) sometimes generates videos where the subject is only partially in view. In
comparison, videos from Sora (right) have improved framing.

Language understanding

Training text-to-video generation systems requires a large amount of videos with corresponding text captions. We apply the re-
captioning technique introduced in DALL·E 3  to videos. We first train a highly descriptive captioner model and then use it to
produce text captions for all videos in our training set. We find that training on highly descriptive video captions improves text

30

fidelity as well as the overall quality of videos.

Similar to DALL·E 3, we also leverage GPT to turn short user prompts into longer detailed captions that are sent to the video model.
This enables Sora to generate high quality videos that accurately follow user prompts.

Sora to simulate some aspects of people, animals and environments from the physical world. These properties emerge without any

Long-range coherence and object permanence. A significant challenge for video generation systems has been maintaining
temporal consistency when sampling long videos. We find that Sora is often, though not always, able to effectively model both

short- and long-range dependencies. For example, our model can persist people, animals and objects even when they are
occluded or leave the frame. Likewise, it can generate multiple shots of the same character in a single sample, maintaining their
appearance throughout the video.

Sora currently exhibits numerous limitations as a simulator. For example, it does not accurately model the physics of many basic
interactions, like glass shattering. Other interactions, like eating food, do not always yield correct changes in object state. We

Specifically, we train text-conditional diffusion models jointly on videos and images of variable durations, resolutions and aspect ratios. We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity video. Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI : / : This technical report focuses on () our method for turning visual data of all types into a unified representation that enables large- scale training of generative models, and () qualitative evaluation of Soras capabilities and limitations. Model and implementation details are not included in this report. Much prior work has studied generative modeling of video data using a variety of methods, including recurrent networks, , , generative adversarial networks, , , , autoregressive transformers, , and diffusion models. , , These works often focus on a narrow category of visual data, on shorter videos, or on videos of a fixed size. Sora is a generalist model of visual datait can generate videos and images spanning diverse durations, aspect ratios and resolutions, up to a full minute of high definition video. Turning visual data into patches The We take inspiration from large language models which acquire generalist capabilities by training on internet-scale data. success of the LLM paradigm is enabled in part by the use of tokens that elegantly unify diverse modalities of textcode, math , and various natural languages. In this work, we consider how generative models of visual data can inherit such benefits. Whereas LLMs have text tokens, Sora has visual patches. Patches have previously been shown to be an effective representation for models of visual data. , , , We find that patches are a highly-scalable and effective representation for training generative models on diverse types of videos and images.

We're also pleased to share that Genmo has raised a $28.4 million Series A

funding round led by NEA led by Rick Yang with participation from The House

Fund, Gold House Ventures, WndrCo, Eastlink Capital Partners, and Essence VC,

as well as angel investors Abhay Parasnis (CEO of Typespace), Amjad Masad

(CEO of Replit), Sabrina Hahn, Bonita Stewart, and Michele Catasta.

At Genmo, our mission is to unlock the right brain of artificial general intelligence.

Mochi 1 is the first step toward building world simulators that can imagine

anything, whether possible or impossible.

Our team includes core members of projects like DDPM (Denoising Diffusion

Probabilistic Models), DreamFusion, and Emu Video. Genmo is advised by leading

technical experts, including Ion Stoica (Executive Chairman and co-founder of

Databricks and Anyscale), Pieter Abbeel (co-founder of Covariant and early team

at OpenAI), and Joey Gonzalez (pioneer in language model systems and co-

founder of Turi).

Evaluations

Today, there is an enormous gap between video generation models and reality.

Motion quality and prompt adherence are two of the most critical capabilities that

are still missing from video generation models.

Mochi 1 sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation. It

also performs very competitively with the leading closed models. Specifically, our

480p preview has strong:

Prompt Adherence: Demonstrates exceptional alignment with textual prompts,

ensuring that generated videos accurately reflect the given instructions. This

allows users detailed control over characters, settings and actions. We

benchmark prompt adherence with an automated metric using a vision

language model as a judge following the protocol in OpenAI DALL-E 3. We

evaluate generated videos using Gemini-1.5-Pro-002.

Motion Quality: Mochi 1 generates smooth videos at 30 frames per second for

durations up to 5.4 seconds, with high temporal coherence and realistic motion

Limitations

Under the research preview, Mochi 1 is a living and evolving checkpoint. There are

a few known limitations. The initial release generates videos at 480p today. In

some edge cases with extreme motion, minor warping and distortions can also

occur. Mochi 1 is also optimized for photorealistic styles so does not perform well

with animated content. We also anticipate that the community will fine-tune the

model to suit various aesthetic preferences. Additionally, we have implemented

robust safety moderation protocols in the playground to ensure that all video

generations remain safe and aligned with ethical guidelines.

Model Architecture

Mochi 1 represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation,

featuring a 10 billion parameter diffusion model built on our novel Asymmetric

Diffusion Transformer (AsymmDiT) architecture. Trained entirely from scratch, it is

the largest video generative model ever openly released. And best of all, itʼs a

simple, hackable architecture.

Efficiency is critical to ensure the community can run our models. Alongside

Mochi, we are open-sourcing our video VAE. Our VAE causally compresses

videos to a 96x smaller size, with an 8x8 spatial and a 6x temporal compression

to a 12-channel latent space.

About

Careers

An AsymmDiT efficiently processes user prompts alongside compressed video

tokens by streamlining text processing and focusing neural network capacity on

visual reasoning. AsymmDiT jointly attends to text and visual tokens with multi-

modal self-attention and learns separate MLP layers for each modality, similar to

Stable Diffusion 3. However, our visual stream has nearly 4 times as many

parameters as the text stream via a larger hidden dimension. To unify the

modalities in self-attention, we use non-square QKV and output projection layers.

This asymmetric design reduces inference memory requirements.

Many modern diffusion models use multiple pretrained language models to

represent user prompts. In contrast, Mochi 1 simply encodes prompts with a

single T5-XXL language model.

Mochi 1 jointly reasons over a context window of 44,520 video tokens with full 3D

attention. To localize each token, we extend learnable rotary positional

embeddings (RoPE) to 3-dimensions. The network end-to-end learns mixing

frequencies for space and time axes.

Mochi benefits from some of the latest improvements in language model scaling

including SwiGLU feedforward layers, query-key normalization for enhanced

stability, and sandwich normalization to control internal activations.

A technical paper will follow with additional details to encourage progress in video

generation.

Open-Source Release

We are releasing Mochi 1 under the Apache 2.0 license. Itʼs critical that there is an

open research ecosystem around video generation. We believe that open-source

models drive progress and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

human or AI agent using keyboard and mouse inputs.

DeepMind

Games play a key role in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Their
engaging nature, unique blend of challenges, and measurable progress make them
ideal environments to safely test and advance AI capabilities.

Indeed, games have been important to Google DeepMind since our founding. From
our early work with Atari games, breakthroughs such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar, to

our research on generalist agents in collaboration with game developers, games
have been center stage in our research. However, training more general embodied
agents has been traditionally bottlenecked by the availability of sufficiently rich and
diverse training environments.

As we show, Genie 2 could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in a
limitless curriculum of novel worlds. Our research also paves the way for new,
creative workflows for prototyping interactive experiences.

Genie 2: A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind

Until now, world models have largely been confined to modeling narrow domains. In

Genie 1, we introduced an approach for generating a diverse array of 2D worlds.

DeepMind

Today we introduce Genie 2, which represents a significant leap forward in

generality. Genie 2 can generate a vast diversity of rich 3D worlds.

Genie 2 is a world model, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the

consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). It was trained on a large-

scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various

emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character

animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other

agents.

Below are example videos of people interacting with Genie 2. For every example,

the model is prompted with a single image generated by Imagen 3, GDM’s state-of-

the-art text-to-image model. This means anyone can describe a world they want in

text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with

that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each

step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie 2

simulates the next observation. Genie 2 can generate consistent worlds for up to a

minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting 10-20s.

Action controls

Genie 2 responds intelligently to actions taken by pressing keys on a keyboard,

identifying the character and moving it correctly. For example, our model has to

figure out that arrow keys should move the robot and not the trees or clouds.

Generating counterfactuals

We can generate diverse trajectories from the same starting frame, which means it

is possible to simulate counterfactual experiences for training agents. In each row,
each video starts from the same frame, but has different actions taken by a human

player.

By using Genie 2 to quickly create rich and diverse environments for AI agents, our
researchers can also generate evaluation tasks that agents have not seen during
training. Below, we show examples of a SIMA agent that we developed in

DeepMind

collaboration with games developers, following instructions on unseen
environments synthesized by Genie 2 via a single image prompt.

Image generated by Imagen 3

Prompt: ""A screenshot of a third-person open world exploration game. The player is an

adventurer exploring a forest. There is a house with a red door on the left, and a house with a

blue door on the right. The camera is placed directly behind the player. #photorealistic

#immersive""

The SIMA agent is designed to complete tasks in a range of 3D game worlds by
following natural-language instructions. Here we used Genie 2 to generate a 3D
environment with two doors, a blue and a red one, and provided instructions to the

SIMA agent to open each of them. In this example, SIMA is controlling the avatar via
keyboard and mouse inputs, while Genie 2 generates the game frames.

We can also use SIMA to help evaluate Genie 2’s capabilities. Here we test Genie 2’s
ability to generate consistent environments by instructing SIMA to look around and
explore behind the house.

Prompt “Turn around”

Prompt “Go behind the house”

While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement

on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie 2 is the
path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while
achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI.

Diffusion world model

Genie 2 is an autoregressive latent diffusion model, trained on a large video
dataset. After passing through an autoencoder, latent frames from the video are
passed to a large transformer dynamics model, trained with a causal mask similar
to that used by large language models.

At inference time, Genie 2 can be sampled in an autoregressive fashion, taking

individual actions and past latent frames on a frame-by-frame basis. We use
classifier-free guidance to improve action controllability.

The samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show
what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in
quality of the outputs.

environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early

Based on a single prompt image, it can be played by a human or AI agent using keyboard and mouse inputs. DeepMind Games play a key role in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Their engaging nature, unique blend of challenges, and measurable progress make them ideal environments to safely test and advance AI capabilities. Indeed, games have been important to Google DeepMind since our founding. From our early work with Atari games, breakthroughs such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar, to our research on generalist agents in collaboration with game developers, games have been center stage in our research. However, training more general embodied agents has been traditionally bottlenecked by the availability of sufficiently rich and diverse training environments. As we show, Genie could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in a limitless curriculum of novel worlds. Our research also paves the way for new, creative workflows for prototyping interactive experiences. Emergent capabilities of a foundation world model https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind Until now, world models have largely been confined to modeling narrow domains. In Genie , we introduced an approach for generating a diverse array of D worlds. DeepMind Today we introduce Genie , which represents a significant leap forward in generality. Genie can generate a vast diversity of rich D worlds. Genie is a world model, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). It was trained on a large- scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents. Below are example videos of people interacting with Genie . For every example, the model is prompted with a single image generated by Imagen , GDMs state-of- the-art text-to-image model. This means anyone can describe a world they want in text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie simulates the next observation. Genie can generate consistent worlds for up to a minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting -s. Action controls Genie responds intelligently to actions taken by pressing keys on a keyboard, identifying the character and moving it correctly. For example, our model has to figure out that arrow keys should move the robot and not the trees or clouds. A cute humanoid robot in the woods. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind A humanoid robot in Ancient Egypt. A first person view of a robot on a purple planet. A first person view of a robot in a loft apartment in a big city. Generating counterfactuals We can generate diverse trajectories from the same starting frame, which means it is possible to simulate counterfactual experiences for training agents. In each row, each video starts from the same frame, but has different actions taken by a human player. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Long horizon memory Genie is capable of remembering parts of the world that are no longer in view and then rendering them accurately when they become observable again. Long video generation with new generated content https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind Genie generates new plausible content on the fly and maintains a consistent world for up to a minute.

Object aordances and interactions https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind Genie models various object interactions, such as bursting balloons, opening DeepMind doors, and shooting barrels of explosives.

Playing from real world images Genie can also be prompted with real world images, where we see that it can model grass blowing in the wind or water flowing in a river. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Genie prompted with real world photos. Genie enables rapid prototyping Genie makes it easy to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences, enabling researchers to quickly experiment with novel environments to train and test embodied AI agents. For example, below we prompt Genie with different images generated by Imagen to model the difference between flying a paper plane, a dragon, a hawk, or a parachute and test how well Genie can animate different avatars. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Genie can be used to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences. Thanks to Genie 's out-of-distribution generalization capabilities, concept art and drawings can be turned into fully interactive environments. This enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research. Here we show examples of research environment concepts made by our concept artist. Environment concept by Max Cant Genie Environment concept by Max Cant Genie AI agents acting inside the world model https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind By using Genie to quickly create rich and diverse environments for AI agents, our researchers can also generate evaluation tasks that agents have not seen during training. Below, we show examples of a SIMA agent that we developed in DeepMind collaboration with games developers, following instructions on unseen environments synthesized by Genie via a single image prompt. Image generated by Imagen Prompt: ""A screenshot of a third-person open world exploration game. The player is an adventurer exploring a forest. There is a house with a red door on the left, and a house with a blue door on the right. The camera is placed directly behind the player. #photorealistic #immersive"" The SIMA agent is designed to complete tasks in a range of D game worlds by following natural-language instructions. Here we used Genie to generate a D environment with two doors, a blue and a red one, and provided instructions to the SIMA agent to open each of them. In this example, SIMA is controlling the avatar via keyboard and mouse inputs, while Genie generates the game frames. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Prompt Open the blue door Prompt Open the red door We can also use SIMA to help evaluate Genie s capabilities. Here we test Genie s ability to generate consistent environments by instructing SIMA to look around and explore behind the house. Prompt Turn around Prompt Go behind the house While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Image generated by Imagen Prompt: ""An image of a computer game showing a scene from inside a rough hewn stone cave or mine. The viewer's position is a rd person camera based above a player avatar looking down towards the avatar. The player avatar is a knight with a sword. In front of the knight avatar there are x stone arched doorways and the knight chooses to go through any one of these doors. Beyond the first and inside we can see strange green plants with glowing flowers lining that tunnel. Inside and beyond the second doorway there is a corridor of spiked iron plates riveted to the cave walls leading towards an ominous glow further along. Through the third door we can see a set of rough hewn stone steps ascending to a mysterious destination."" Prompt Go up the stairs Prompt Go where the plants are https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Prompt Go to the middle door Diffusion world model Genie is an autoregressive latent diffusion model, trained on a large video dataset. After passing through an autoencoder, latent frames from the video are passed to a large transformer dynamics model, trained with a causal mask similar to that used by large language models. At inference time, Genie can be sampled in an autoregressive fashion, taking individual actions and past latent frames on a frame-by-frame basis. We use classifier-free guidance to improve action controllability. The samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in quality of the outputs. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Developing our technologies responsibly Genie shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse D environments and accelerating agent research.

Announcing Black Forest Labs

Aug 1, 2024 — by BlackForestLabs in News.

Today, we are excited to announce the launch of Black Forest Labs. Deeply

rooted in the generative AI research community, our mission is to develop and

advance state-of-the-art generative deep learning models for media such as

images and videos, and to push the boundaries of creativity, e ciency and

diversity. We believe that generative AI will be a fundamental building block of

all future technologies. By making our models available to a wide audience, we

want to bring its beneﬁts to everyone, educate the public and enhance trust in

the safety of these models. We are determined to build the industry standard for

generative media. Today, as the ﬁrst step towards this goal, we release the

FLUX.1 suite of models that push the frontiers of text-to-image synthesis.

The Black Forest Team

We are a team of distinguished AI researchers and engineers with an

outstanding track record in developing foundational generative AI models in

academic, industrial, and open-source environments. Our innovations include

creating VQGAN and Latent Di usion, The Stable Di usion models for image

and video generation (Stable Di usion XL, Stable Video Di usion, Rectiﬁed Flow

Transformers), and Adversarial Di usion Distillation for ultra-fast, real-time

image synthesis.

Our core belief is that widely accessible models not only foster innovation and

collaboration within the research community and academia, but also increase

transparency, which is essential for trust and broad adoption. Our team strives

to develop the highest quality technology and to make it accessible to the

broadest audience possible.

Funding 

We are excited to announce the successful closing of our Series Seed funding

round of $31 million. This round was led by our main investor, Andreessen

Horowitz, including notable participation from angel investors Brendan Iribe,

Michael Ovitz, Garry Tan, Timo Aila and Vladlen Koltun and other renowned

experts in AI research and company building. We have received follow-up

investments from General Catalyst and MätchVC to support us on our mission

to bring state-of-the-art AI from Europe to everyone around the world.

Furthermore, we are pleased to announce our advisory board, including Michael

Ovitz, bringing extensive experience in the content creation industry, and Prof.

Matthias Bethge, pioneer of neural style transfer and leading expert in open

European AI research.

Flux.1 Model Family

We release the FLUX.1 suite of text-to-image models that deﬁne a new state-of-

the-art in image detail, prompt adherence, style diversity and scene complexity

for text-to-image synthesis. 

To strike a balance between accessibility and model capabilities, FLUX.1 comes

in three variants: FLUX.1 [pro], FLUX.1 [dev] and FLUX.1 [schnell]: 

FLUX.1 [pro]: The best of FLUX.1, o ering state-of-the-art performance image

generation with top of the line prompt following, visual quality, image detail

and output diversity. Sign up for FLUX.1 [pro] access via our API here. FLUX.1

[pro] is also available via Replicate and fal.ai. Moreover we o er dedicated and

customized enterprise solutions – reach out via ﬂux@blackforestlabs.ai to get

in touch.

FLUX.1 [dev]: FLUX.1 [dev] is an open-weight, guidance-distilled model for

non-commercial applications. Directly distilled from FLUX.1 [pro], FLUX.1

[dev] obtains similar quality and prompt adherence capabilities, while being

are available on HuggingFace and can be directly tried out on Replicate or

Fal.ai. For applications in commercial contexts, get in touch out via

ﬂux@blackforestlabs.ai. 

FLUX.1 [schnell]: our fastest model is tailored for local development and

personal use. FLUX.1 [schnell] is openly available under an Apache2.0 license.

Similar, FLUX.1 [dev], weights are available on Hugging Face and inference

code can be found on GitHub and in HuggingFace’s Di users. Moreover we’re

happy to have day-1 integration for ComfyUI.

Transformer-powered Flow Models at Scale 

All public FLUX.1 models are based on a hybrid architecture of multimodal and

parallel di usion transformer blocks and scaled to 12B parameters. We improve

over previous state-of-the-art di usion models by building on ﬂow matching, a

general and conceptually simple method for training generative models, which

includes di usion as a special case. In addition, we increase model performance

and improve hardware e ciency by incorporating rotary positional embeddings

and parallel attention layers. We will publish a more detailed tech report in the

near future.

A new Benchmark for Image Synthesis 

FLUX.1 deﬁnes the new state-of-the-art in image synthesis. Our models set new

standards in their respective model class. FLUX.1 [pro] and [dev] surpass

popular  models like Midjourney v6.0, DALL·E 3 (HD) and SD3-Ultra in each of

the following aspects: Visual Quality, Prompt Following, Size/Aspect Variability,

Typography and Output Diversity. FLUX.1 [schnell] is the most advanced few-

step model to date, outperforming not even its in-class competitors but also
