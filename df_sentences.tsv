1	modelsgenvideo	1	Today we're sharing our first step towards spatial intelligence: an AI system that generates D worlds from a single image.
1	modelsgenvideo	2	This lets you step into any image and explore it in D. Beyond the input image, all is generated: Input Image D World Most GenAI tools make D content like images or videos.
1	modelsgenvideo	3	Generating in D instead improves control and consistency.
1	modelsgenvideo	4	This will change how we make movies, games, simulators, and other digital manifestations of our physical world.
1	modelsgenvideo	5	In this post you'll explore our generated worlds, rendered live in your browser.
1	modelsgenvideo	6	You'll also experience different camera effects, D effects, and dive into classic paintings.
1	modelsgenvideo	7	Finally, you'll see how creators are already building with our models.
1	modelsgenvideo	8	It's your turn to explore some worlds!
1	modelsgenvideo	9	Below we show D worlds generated from fantastical images[] and everyday photos.
1	modelsgenvideo	10	[] Use arrow keys or WASD to move, and click and drag with your mouse to look around:
1	modelsgenvideo	11	Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Not seeing interactive D?
1	modelsgenvideo	12	Camera Effects Once a scene is generated, it is rendered live in the browser using a virtual camera.
1	modelsgenvideo	13	Precise control over this camera enables artistic photographic effects.
1	modelsgenvideo	14	We can simulate a shallow depth of field, where only objects at a certain distance from the camera are in focus: Near Far Move the slider to adjust the focus distance Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds
1	modelsgenvideo	15	We can also simulate a dolly zoom which adjusts a camera's position and field of view at the same time: Wide Narrow Move the slider to dolly zoom You can't move in this scene Out of bounds D Effects
1	modelsgenvideo	16	Predicting a D scene instead has many benefits: Persistent Reality: Once a world is generated, it's there to stay.
1	modelsgenvideo	17	The scene won't change behind your back if you look away and come back.
1	modelsgenvideo	18	Real-Time Control: After generating a scene, you can move around it in real-time.
1	modelsgenvideo	19	You can linger on the details of a flower, or peek around a corner to see what is revealed.
1	modelsgenvideo	20	Our generated worlds obey basic physical rules of D geometry.
1	modelsgenvideo	21	They have a sense of solidity and depth that contrasts with the dream-like nature of some AI-generated video.
1	modelsgenvideo	22	The simplest way to visualize the D scene is a depth map where each pixel is colored by its distance to the camera: ColorDepth NearFar Change effects with the buttons above Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We can use the D scene structure to build interactive effects click on the scene to interact with it!
1	modelsgenvideo	23	Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds
1	modelsgenvideo	24	We can also build effects that passively animate the scene:
1	modelsgenvideo	25	RustleWavesColor WaveNone Change effects with the buttons above Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Step into Paintings World generation allows you to experience iconic pieces of art in a new way.
1	modelsgenvideo	26	We generated worlds from our favorite pieces[] by van Gogh, Hopper, Seurat, and Kandinsky.
1	modelsgenvideo	27	Anything not in the original painting was generated by our model.
1	modelsgenvideo	28	Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Creative Workflows D world generation naturally composes with other AI tools.
1	modelsgenvideo	29	This allows creators to work with tools they already know to enable new experiences.
1	modelsgenvideo	30	For example, we can create worlds from text by first generating an image using a text-to- image model.
1	modelsgenvideo	31	Different models have their own style which our worlds can inherit.
1	modelsgenvideo	32	Here we generate four variants of the same scene using different text-to-image models,[] all using the same prompt: A vibrant cartoon-style teenager's bedroom with a bed covered in colorful blankets, a cluttered desk with a computer, posters on the walls, and scattered sports gear.
1	modelsgenvideo	33	A guitar leans against the wall, and a cozy, patterned rug is in the center.
1	modelsgenvideo	34	Light from a window adds a warm, youthful vibe to the room.
1	modelsgenvideo	35	Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We've given a few creators an early sneak peek at our technology to begin experimenting with the possibilities enabled by a D-native generative AI workflow.
1	modelsgenvideo	36	Eric Solorio shows how our models fill a gap in his creative workflow, making it easy to stage characters within scenes and direct precise camera movements: Brittani Natali lays out carefully crafted camera paths through our generated worlds to evoke different moods across three short films, using a workflow combining World Labs' technology with tools like Midjourney, Runway, Suno, ElevenLabs, Blender, and CapCut: Looking Ahead These results are our first early preview of generating D worlds.
1	modelsgenvideo	37	We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them.
1	modelsgenvideo	38	Keep up with our future releases via our waitlist, or get in touch at hello@worldlabs.ai.

5	modelsgenvideo	1	//, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI Video generation models as world simulators February , View Sora overview We explore large-scale training of generative models on video data.
5	modelsgenvideo	2	Specifically, we train text-conditional diffusion models jointly on videos and images of variable durations, resolutions and aspect ratios.
5	modelsgenvideo	3	We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes.
5	modelsgenvideo	4	Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity video.
5	modelsgenvideo	5	Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world.
5	modelsgenvideo	6	//, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI :
5	modelsgenvideo	7	/ : This technical report focuses on () our method for turning visual data of all types into a unified representation that enables large- scale training of generative models, and () qualitative evaluation of Soras capabilities and limitations.
5	modelsgenvideo	8	Model and implementation details are not included in this report.
5	modelsgenvideo	9	Much prior work has studied generative modeling of video data using a variety of methods, including recurrent networks, , , generative adversarial networks, , , , autoregressive transformers, , and diffusion models.
5	modelsgenvideo	10	, , These works often focus on a narrow category of visual data, on shorter videos, or on videos of a fixed size.
5	modelsgenvideo	11	Sora is a generalist model of visual datait can generate videos and images spanning diverse durations, aspect ratios and resolutions, up to a full minute of high definition video.
5	modelsgenvideo	12	Turning visual data into patches The We take inspiration from large language models which acquire generalist capabilities by training on internet-scale data.
5	modelsgenvideo	13	success of the LLM paradigm is enabled in part by the use of tokens that elegantly unify diverse modalities of textcode, math , and various natural languages.
5	modelsgenvideo	14	In this work, we consider how generative models of visual data can inherit such benefits.
5	modelsgenvideo	15	Whereas LLMs have text tokens, Sora has visual patches.
5	modelsgenvideo	16	Patches have previously been shown to be an effective representation for models of visual data.
5	modelsgenvideo	17	, , , We find that patches are a highly-scalable and effective representation for training generative models on diverse types of videos and images.
5	modelsgenvideo	18	At a high level, we turn videos into patches by first compressing videos into a lower-dimensional latent space, and subsequently decomposing the representation into spacetime patches.
5	modelsgenvideo	19	//, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI Video compression network We train a network that reduces the dimensionality of visual data.
5	modelsgenvideo	20	representation that is compressed both temporally and spatially.
5	modelsgenvideo	21	Sora is trained on and subsequently generates videos within this This network takes raw video as input and outputs a latent compressed latent space.
5	modelsgenvideo	22	We also train a corresponding decoder model that maps generated latents back to pixel space.
5	modelsgenvideo	23	Spacetime latent patches Given a compressed input video, we extract a sequence of spacetime patches which act as transformer tokens.
5	modelsgenvideo	24	This scheme works for images too since images are just videos with a single frame.
5	modelsgenvideo	25	Our patch-based representation enables Sora to train on videos and images of variable resolutions, durations and aspect ratios.
5	modelsgenvideo	26	At inference time, we can control the size of generated videos by arranging randomly-initialized patches in an appropriately-sized grid.
5	modelsgenvideo	27	Scaling transformers for video generation Sora is a diffusion model , , , , ; given input noisy patches (and conditioning information like text prompts), its trained to predict the original clean patches.
5	modelsgenvideo	28	Importantly, Sora is a diffusion transformer.
5	modelsgenvideo	29	Transformers have demonstrated remarkable scaling properties across a variety of domains, including language modeling, , computer vision, , , , and image generation.
5	modelsgenvideo	30	, , In this work, we find that diffusion transformers scale effectively as video models as well.
5	modelsgenvideo	31	Below, we show a comparison of video samples with fixed seeds and inputs as training progresses.
5	modelsgenvideo	32	Sample quality improves markedly as training compute increases.

5	modelsgenvideo	35	//, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI x compute Variable durations, resolutions, aspect ratios Past approaches to image and video generation typically resize, crop or trim videos to a standard sizee.g., second videos at resolution.
5	modelsgenvideo	36	We find that instead training on data at its native size provides several benefits.
5	modelsgenvideo	37	Sampling flexibility Sora can sample widescreen p videos, vertical videos and everything inbetween.
5	modelsgenvideo	38	This lets Sora create content for different devices directly at their native aspect ratios.
5	modelsgenvideo	39	It also lets us quickly prototype content at lower sizes before generating at full resolutionall with the same model.

6	modelsgenvideo	12	At Genmo, our mission is to unlock the right brain of artificial general intelligence.
6	modelsgenvideo	13	Mochi is the first step toward building world simulators that can imagine anything, whether possible or impossible.
6	modelsgenvideo	14	Our team includes core members of projects like DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), DreamFusion, and Emu Video.
6	modelsgenvideo	15	Genmo is advised by leading technical experts, including Ion Stoica (Executive Chairman and co-founder of Databricks and Anyscale), Pieter Abbeel (co-founder of Covariant and early team at OpenAI), and Joey Gonzalez (pioneer in language model systems and co- founder of Turi).
6	modelsgenvideo	16	Evaluations Today, there is an enormous gap between video generation models and reality.
6	modelsgenvideo	17	Motion quality and prompt adherence are two of the most critical capabilities that are still missing from video generation models.
6	modelsgenvideo	18	Mochi sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation.
6	modelsgenvideo	19	It also performs very competitively with the leading closed models.
6	modelsgenvideo	20	Specifically, our p preview has strong: Prompt Adherence: Demonstrates exceptional alignment with textual prompts, ensuring that generated videos accurately reflect the given instructions.
6	modelsgenvideo	21	This allows users detailed control over characters, settings and actions.

6	modelsgenvideo	31	//, : genmo.ai/blog About Blog Careers Limitations Under the research preview, Mochi is a living and evolving checkpoint.
6	modelsgenvideo	32	There are a few known limitations.
6	modelsgenvideo	33	The initial release generates videos at p today.
6	modelsgenvideo	34	In some edge cases with extreme motion, minor warping and distortions can also occur.
6	modelsgenvideo	35	Mochi is also optimized for photorealistic styles so does not perform well with animated content.
6	modelsgenvideo	36	We also anticipate that the community will fine-tune the model to suit various aesthetic preferences.
6	modelsgenvideo	37	Additionally, we have implemented robust safety moderation protocols in the playground to ensure that all video generations remain safe and aligned with ethical guidelines.
6	modelsgenvideo	38	Model Architecture Mochi represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation, featuring a billion parameter diffusion model built on our novel Asymmetric Diffusion Transformer (AsymmDiT) architecture.
6	modelsgenvideo	39	Trained entirely from scratch, it is the largest video generative model ever openly released.
6	modelsgenvideo	40	And best of all, its a simple, hackable architecture.
6	modelsgenvideo	41	Efficiency is critical to ensure the community can run our models.
6	modelsgenvideo	42	Alongside Mochi, we are open-sourcing our video VAE.
6	modelsgenvideo	43	Our VAE causally compresses https://www.genmo.ai/blog /
6	modelsgenvideo	44	//, : genmo.ai/blog videos to a x smaller size, with an x spatial and a x temporal compression to a -channel latent space.
6	modelsgenvideo	45	About Blog Careers An AsymmDiT efficiently processes user prompts alongside compressed video tokens by streamlining text processing and focusing neural network capacity on visual reasoning.
6	modelsgenvideo	46	AsymmDiT jointly attends to text and visual tokens with multi- modal self-attention and learns separate MLP layers for each modality, similar to Stable Diffusion .
6	modelsgenvideo	47	However, our visual stream has nearly times as many parameters as the text stream via a larger hidden dimension.
6	modelsgenvideo	48	To unify the modalities in self-attention, we use non-square QKV and output projection layers.
6	modelsgenvideo	49	This asymmetric design reduces inference memory requirements.
6	modelsgenvideo	50	Many modern diffusion models use multiple pretrained language models to represent user prompts.
6	modelsgenvideo	51	In contrast, Mochi simply encodes prompts with a single T-XXL language model.
6	modelsgenvideo	52	Mochi jointly reasons over a context window of , video tokens with full D attention.
6	modelsgenvideo	53	To localize each token, we extend learnable rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) to -dimensions.
6	modelsgenvideo	54	The network end-to-end learns mixing frequencies for space and time axes.
6	modelsgenvideo	55	Mochi benefits from some of the latest improvements in language model scaling including SwiGLU feedforward layers, query-key normalization for enhanced stability, and sandwich normalization to control internal activations.
6	modelsgenvideo	56	A technical paper will follow with additional details to encourage progress in video generation.
6	modelsgenvideo	57	Open-Source Release We are releasing Mochi under the Apache .
6	modelsgenvideo	58	Its critical that there is an open research ecosystem around video generation.
6	modelsgenvideo	59	We believe that open-source models drive progress and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.
