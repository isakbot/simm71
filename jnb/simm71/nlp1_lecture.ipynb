        "**Sustainability Communication and Greenwashing: Definitions and Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "*Sustainability communication* refers to how organizations convey their environmental efforts and commitments to stakeholders, including customers, investors, and the public. It encompasses the strategies and messages used to inform about sustainable practices, goals, and achievements.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Greenwashing* is the practice where an organization gives a false impression or provides misleading information about how its products are more environmentally sound. It's a form of deceptive marketing intended to present an eco-friendly image that doesn't align with reality.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The Relationship Between Sustainability Communication and Greenwashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "While sustainability communication aims to transparently share genuine environmental initiatives, greenwashing undermines this by distorting the truth. Effective sustainability communication builds trust and accountability, whereas greenwashing can damage an organization's reputation and lead to consumer skepticism.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Case Study: Preem and Vattenfall**\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider two organizations:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Preem**: A Swedish petroleum company primarily involved in refining and selling fossil fuels.\n",
        "- **Vattenfall**: A Swedish power company engaged in energy production, including renewables like wind and hydroelectric power, as well as traditional sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both companies engage in sustainability communication to highlight their environmental efforts. However, their core businesses differ, which might influence the content and tone of their messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Using spaCy NLP to Analyze Sustainability Communication**\n",
        "\n",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools like **spaCy** can help analyze the language used in sustainability reports, press releases, and other communications from these organizations. By examining tokens (words) and parts of speech (POS), we can gain insights into their messaging strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how we can proceed:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tokenization and POS Tagging**: Using spaCy, we tokenize the text and assign POS tags to each token, identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Adjectives**: Analyze the use of descriptive words such as \"sustainable,\" \"green,\" \"renewable,\" or \"clean.\" A high frequency of positive environmental adjectives might be used to enhance the company's eco-friendly image.\n",
        "   - **Nouns and Verbs**: Examine the key nouns and verbs to understand what actions the company emphasizes (e.g., \"reducing emissions,\" \"investing,\" \"innovating\").\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Comparative Analysis**:\n",
        "   - **Preem**: As a fossil fuel company, Preem might focus on terms like \"transition,\" \"carbon capture,\" or \"efficiency.\" The language may highlight efforts to mitigate environmental impact while continuing core operations.\n",
        "   - **Vattenfall**: With a significant stake in renewables, Vattenfall's communication might frequently include words like \"wind power,\" \"sustainability,\" and \"renewable energy,\" reflecting a strategic shift toward greener energy sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Identifying Potential Greenwashing Indicators**:\n",
        "   - **Discrepancies**: Look for a mismatch between the frequency of positive environmental language and the company's actual environmental performance or core activities.\n",
        "   - **Vagueness and Jargon**: Excessive use of buzzwords without concrete actions or data might indicate greenwashing.\n",
        "   - **Overemphasis on Minor Initiatives**: Highlighting small sustainable projects while major operations remain environmentally harmful.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Determining Levels of Greenwashing**\n",
        "\n",
        "By quantitatively analyzing the language used, we can infer the level of greenwashing:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Level**: Predominant use of positive environmental adjectives with little mention of substantive actions or acknowledgment of environmental challenges.\n",
        "- **Moderate Level**: Balanced use of positive language and discussion of both achievements and ongoing issues.\n",
        "- **Low Level**: Transparent communication with specific data, acknowledging areas for improvement, and outlining concrete steps being taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion**\n",
        "\n",
        "Applying spaCy NLP to sustainability communications allows us to dissect the linguistic patterns and assess the authenticity of an organization's environmental messaging. By examining the parts of speech and token frequency, we can gain insights into whether companies like Preem and Vattenfall are engaging in genuine sustainability efforts or potentially greenwashing their practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis not only sheds light on their communication strategies but also promotes greater accountability and encourages more truthful and transparent sustainability reporting."

Mochi 1 demonstrates dramatic improvements in quality\\n\\nof motion as well as extremely strong prompt adherence. Licensed under the\\n\\nApache 2.0 license, a preview of Mochi 1 is freely available for personal and\\n\\ncommercial use.\\n\\nIn addition to the model release, we're excited to unveil our hosted playground,\\n\\nwhere you can try Mochi 1 for free today at genmo.ai/play. The weights and\\n\\nhttps://www.genmo.ai/blog\\n\\n1/7\\n\\n\\f05/12/2024, 19:31\\n\\ngenmo.ai/blog\\n\\narchitecture for Mochi 1 are open and available on HuggingFace. Today, we are\\n\\nAbout\\nreleasing our 480p base model, with Mochi 1 HD coming later this year.\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nWe're also pleased to share that Genmo has raised a $28.4 million Series A\\n\\nfunding round led by NEA led by Rick Yang with participation from The House\\n\\nFund, Gold House Ventures, WndrCo, Eastlink Capital Partners, and Essence VC,\\n\\nas well as angel investors Abhay Parasnis (CEO of Typespace), Amjad Masad\\n\\n(CEO of Replit), Sabrina Hahn, Bonita Stewart, and Michele Catasta.\\n\\nAt Genmo, our mission is to unlock the right brain of artificial general intelligence.\\n\\nMochi 1 is the first step toward building world simulators that can imagine\\n\\nanything, whether possible or impossible.\\n\\nOur team includes core members of projects like DDPM (Denoising Diffusion\\n\\nProbabilistic Models), DreamFusion, and Emu Video. Genmo is advised by leading\\n\\ntechnical experts, including Ion Stoica (Executive Chairman and co-founder of\\n\\nDatabricks and Anyscale), Pieter Abbeel (co-founder of Covariant and early team\\n\\nat OpenAI), and Joey Gonzalez (pioneer in language model systems and co-\\n\\nfounder of Turi).\\n\\nEvaluations\\n\\nToday, there is an enormous gap between video generation models and reality.\\n\\nMotion quality and prompt adherence are two of the most critical capabilities that\\n\\nare still missing from video generation models.\\n\\nMochi 1 sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation. It\\n\\nalso performs very competitively with the leading closed models. Specifically, our\\n\\n480p preview has strong:\\n\\nPrompt Adherence: Demonstrates exceptional alignment with textual prompts,\\n\\nensuring that generated videos accurately reflect the given instructions. This\\n\\nallows users detailed control over characters, settings and actions. We\\n\\nbenchmark prompt adherence with an automated metric using a vision\\n\\nlanguage model as a judge following the protocol in OpenAI DALL-E 3. We\\n\\nevaluate generated videos using Gemini-1.5-Pro-002.\\n\\nMotion Quality: Mochi 1 generates smooth videos at 30 frames per second for\\n\\ndurations up to 5.4 seconds, with high temporal coherence and realistic motion\\n\\nhttps://www.genmo.ai/blog\\n\\n2/7\\n\\n\\f05/12/2024, 19:31\\n\\ngenmo.ai/blog\\n\\ndynamics.

Raters were instructed to focus on motion rather than frame-\\n\\nlevel aesthetics (criteria include interestingness of the motion, physical\\n\\nplausibility, and fluidity). Elo scores are computed following the LMSYS Chatbot\\n\\nArena protocol.\\n\\nPrompt Adherence\\nMeasures how accurately generated videos follow the provided textual instructions,\\nensuring high fidelity to user intent.\\n\\nElo Score\\nEvaluates both motion smoothness and spatial realism, ensuring that generated videos\\nare fluid and visually captivating.\\n\\nhttps://www.genmo.ai/blog\\n\\n3/7\\n\\n\\f05/12/2024, 19:31\\n\\ngenmo.ai/blog\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nUnder the research preview, Mochi 1 is a living and evolving checkpoint. There are\\n\\na few known limitations. The initial release generates videos at 480p today. In\\n\\nsome edge cases with extreme motion, minor warping and distortions can also\\n\\noccur. Mochi 1 is also optimized for photorealistic styles so does not perform well\\n\\nwith animated content. We also anticipate that the community will fine-tune the\\n\\nmodel to suit various aesthetic preferences. Additionally, we have implemented\\n\\nrobust safety moderation protocols in the playground to ensure that all video\\n\\ngenerations remain safe and aligned with ethical guidelines.\\n\\nModel Architecture\\n\\nMochi 1 represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation,\\n\\nfeaturing a 10 billion parameter diffusion model built on our novel Asymmetric\\n\\nDiffusion Transformer (AsymmDiT) architecture. Trained entirely from scratch, it is\\n\\nthe largest video generative model ever openly released. And best of all, it\\u02bcs a\\n\\nsimple, hackable architecture.\\n\\nEfficiency is critical to ensure the community can run our models. Alongside\\n\\nMochi, we are open-sourcing our video VAE. Our VAE causally compresses\\n\\nhttps://www.genmo.ai/blog\\n\\n4/7\\n\\n\\f05/12/2024, 19:31\\n\\ngenmo.ai/blog\\n\\nvideos to a 96x smaller size, with an 8x8 spatial and a 6x temporal compression\\n\\nto a 12-channel latent space.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nCareers\\n\\nAn AsymmDiT efficiently processes user prompts alongside compressed video\\n\\ntokens by streamlining text processing and focusing neural network capacity on\\n\\nvisual reasoning. AsymmDiT jointly attends to text and visual tokens with multi-\\n\\nmodal self-attention and learns separate MLP layers for each modality, similar to\\n\\nStable Diffusion 3. However, our visual stream has nearly 4 times as many\\n\\nparameters as the text stream via a larger hidden dimension. To unify the\\n\\nmodalities in self-attention, we use non-square QKV and output projection layers.\\n\\nThis asymmetric design reduces inference memory requirements.\\n\\nMany modern diffusion models use multiple pretrained language models to\\n\\nrepresent user prompts. In contrast, Mochi 1 simply encodes prompts with a\\n\\nsingle T5-XXL language model.\\n\\nMochi 1 jointly reasons over a context window of 44,520 video tokens with full 3D\\n\\nattention. To localize each token, we extend learnable rotary positional\\n\\nembeddings (RoPE) to 3-dimensions. The network end-to-end learns mixing\\n\\nfrequencies for space and time axes.\\n\\nMochi benefits from some of the latest improvements in language model scaling\\n\\nincluding SwiGLU feedforward layers, query-key normalization for enhanced\\n\\nstability, and sandwich normalization to control internal activations.\\n\\nA technical paper will follow with additional details to encourage progress in video\\n\\ngeneration.\\n\\nOpen-Source Release\\n\\nWe are releasing Mochi 1 under the Apache 2.0 license. It\\u02bcs critical that there is an\\n\\nopen research ecosystem around video generation. We believe that open-source\\n\\nmodels drive progress and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.\\n\\nTry Mochi 1 today\\n\\nhttps://www.genmo.ai/blog\\n\\n5/7\\n\\n\\f05/12/2024, 19:31\\n\\ngenmo.ai/blog\\n\\nExperience Mochi 1 firsthand through our hosted playground at genmo.ai/play.\\n\\nGenerate videos from your own prompts and explore the capabilities of the model\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nBlog\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\u2014all for free.\\n\\nDeveloper Resources\\n\\nWe have partnered with leading platforms to make Mochi 1 easily accessible:\\n\\nOpen weights: Download the weights from huggingface.co/genmo or via\\n\\nmagnet link.\\n\\nGitHub Repository: Access the source code at github.com/genmoai/models.\\n\\nAPIs partners: Integrate Mochi 1 into your applications seamlessly using APIs\\n\\nfrom our partners.\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nOur research preview of Mochi 1 opens up new possibilities across various\\n\\ndomains:\\n\\nResearch and Development: Advance the field of video generation and\\n\\nexplore new methodologies.\\n\\nProduct Development: Build innovative applications in entertainment,\\n\\nadvertising, education, and more.\\n\\nCreative Expression: Empower artists and creators to bring their visions to life\\n\\nwith AI-generated videos.\\n\\nRobotics: Generate synthetic data for training AI models in robotics,\\n\\nautonomous vehicles and virtual environments.\\n\\nWhat is coming next?\\n\\nToday, we are releasing the Mochi 1 preview, showcasing the capabilities of our\\n\\n480p base model.

Our new model dramatically closes the gap between closed and open video generation systems. We're releasing the model under a permissive Apache . license. Download the weights now or try this preview version for free on our playground. Introduction We are thrilled to announce a research preview of Mochi , our latest open-source video generation model. Mochi demonstrates dramatic improvements in quality of motion as well as extremely strong prompt adherence. Licensed under the Apache . license, a preview of Mochi is freely available for personal and commercial use. In addition to the model release, we're excited to unveil our hosted playground, where you can try Mochi for free today at genmo.ai/play. The weights and https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog architecture for Mochi are open and available on HuggingFace. Today, we are About releasing our p base model, with Mochi HD coming later this year. Careers Blog We're also pleased to share that Genmo has raised a $. million Series A funding round led by NEA led by Rick Yang with participation from The House Fund, Gold House Ventures, WndrCo, Eastlink Capital Partners, and Essence VC, as well as angel investors Abhay Parasnis (CEO of Typespace), Amjad Masad (CEO of Replit), Sabrina Hahn, Bonita Stewart, and Michele Catasta. At Genmo, our mission is to unlock the right brain of artificial general intelligence. Mochi is the first step toward building world simulators that can imagine anything, whether possible or impossible. Our team includes core members of projects like DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), DreamFusion, and Emu Video. Genmo is advised by leading technical experts, including Ion Stoica (Executive Chairman and co-founder of Databricks and Anyscale), Pieter Abbeel (co-founder of Covariant and early team at OpenAI), and Joey Gonzalez (pioneer in language model systems and co- founder of Turi). Evaluations Today, there is an enormous gap between video generation models and reality. Motion quality and prompt adherence are two of the most critical capabilities that are still missing from video generation models. Mochi sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation. It also performs very competitively with the leading closed models. Specifically, our p preview has strong: Prompt Adherence: Demonstrates exceptional alignment with textual prompts, ensuring that generated videos accurately reflect the given instructions. This allows users detailed control over characters, settings and actions. We benchmark prompt adherence with an automated metric using a vision language model as a judge following the protocol in OpenAI DALL-E . We evaluate generated videos using Gemini-.-Pro-. Motion Quality: Mochi generates smooth videos at frames per second for durations up to . seconds, with high temporal coherence and realistic motion https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog dynamics. Mochi simulates physics like fluid dynamics, fur and hair simulation, and expresses consistent, fluid human action that is beginning to cross the About Blog Careers uncanny valley. Raters were instructed to focus on motion rather than frame- level aesthetics (criteria include interestingness of the motion, physical plausibility, and fluidity). Elo scores are computed following the LMSYS Chatbot Arena protocol. Prompt Adherence Measures how accurately generated videos follow the provided textual instructions, ensuring high fidelity to user intent. Elo Score Evaluates both motion smoothness and spatial realism, ensuring that generated videos are fluid and visually captivating. https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog About Blog Careers Limitations Under the research preview, Mochi is a living and evolving checkpoint. There are a few known limitations. The initial release generates videos at p today. In some edge cases with extreme motion, minor warping and distortions can also occur. Mochi is also optimized for photorealistic styles so does not perform well with animated content. We also anticipate that the community will fine-tune the model to suit various aesthetic preferences. Additionally, we have implemented robust safety moderation protocols in the playground to ensure that all video generations remain safe and aligned with ethical guidelines. Model Architecture Mochi represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation, featuring a billion parameter diffusion model built on our novel Asymmetric Diffusion Transformer (AsymmDiT) architecture. Trained entirely from scratch, it is the largest video generative model ever openly released. And best of all, its a simple, hackable architecture. Efficiency is critical to ensure the community can run our models. Alongside Mochi, we are open-sourcing our video VAE. Our VAE causally compresses https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog videos to a x smaller size, with an x spatial and a x temporal compression to a -channel latent space. About Blog Careers An AsymmDiT efficiently processes user prompts alongside compressed video tokens by streamlining text processing and focusing neural network capacity on visual reasoning. AsymmDiT jointly attends to text and visual tokens with multi- modal self-attention and learns separate MLP layers for each modality, similar to Stable Diffusion . However, our visual stream has nearly times as many parameters as the text stream via a larger hidden dimension. To unify the modalities in self-attention, we use non-square QKV and output projection layers. This asymmetric design reduces inference memory requirements. Many modern diffusion models use multiple pretrained language models to represent user prompts. In contrast, Mochi simply encodes prompts with a single T-XXL language model. Mochi jointly reasons over a context window of , video tokens with full D attention. To localize each token, we extend learnable rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) to -dimensions. The network end-to-end learns mixing frequencies for space and time axes. Mochi benefits from some of the latest improvements in language model scaling including SwiGLU feedforward layers, query-key normalization for enhanced stability, and sandwich normalization to control internal activations. A technical paper will follow with additional details to encourage progress in video generation. Open-Source Release We are releasing Mochi under the Apache . license. Its critical that there is an open research ecosystem around video generation. We believe that open-source models drive progress and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

                        Today we're sharing our first step towards spatial intelligence: an AI system that generates D worlds from a single image. This lets you step into any image and explore it in D. Beyond the input image, all is generated: Input Image D World Most GenAI tools make D content like images or videos. Generating in D instead improves control and consistency. This will change how we make movies, games, simulators, and other digital manifestations of our physical world. In this post you'll explore our generated worlds, rendered live in your browser. You'll also experience different camera effects, D effects, and dive into classic paintings. Finally, you'll see how creators are already building with our models. Explore a World It's your turn to explore some worlds! Below we show D worlds generated from fantastical images[] and everyday photos.[] Use arrow keys or WASD to move, and click and drag with your mouse to look around: Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Not seeing interactive D? Click here. Camera Effects Once a scene is generated, it is rendered live in the browser using a virtual camera. Precise control over this camera enables artistic photographic effects. We can simulate a shallow depth of field, where only objects at a certain distance from the camera are in focus: Near Far Move the slider to adjust the focus distance Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We can also simulate a dolly zoom which adjusts a camera's position and field of view at the same time: Wide Narrow Move the slider to dolly zoom You can't move in this scene Out of bounds D Effects Most generative models predict pixels. Predicting a D scene instead has many benefits: Persistent Reality: Once a world is generated, it's there to stay. The scene won't change behind your back if you look away and come back. Real-Time Control: After generating a scene, you can move around it in real-time. You can linger on the details of a flower, or peek around a corner to see what is revealed. Correct Geometry: Our generated worlds obey basic physical rules of D geometry. They have a sense of solidity and depth that contrasts with the dream-like nature of some AI-generated video. The simplest way to visualize the D scene is a depth map where each pixel is colored by its distance to the camera: ColorDepth NearFar Change effects with the buttons above Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We can use the D scene structure to build interactive effects click on the scene to interact with it! SonarSpotlightRippleNone Click to interact! Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We can also build effects that passively animate the scene: RustleWavesColor WaveNone Change effects with the buttons above Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Step into Paintings World generation allows you to experience iconic pieces of art in a new way. We generated worlds from our favorite pieces[] by van Gogh, Hopper, Seurat, and Kandinsky. Anything not in the original painting was generated by our model. Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds Creative Workflows D world generation naturally composes with other AI tools. This allows creators to work with tools they already know to enable new experiences. For example, we can create worlds from text by first generating an image using a text-to- image model. Different models have their own style which our worlds can inherit. Here we generate four variants of the same scene using different text-to-image models,[] all using the same prompt: A vibrant cartoon-style teenager's bedroom with a bed covered in colorful blankets, a cluttered desk with a computer, posters on the walls, and scattered sports gear. A guitar leans against the wall, and a cozy, patterned rug is in the center. Light from a window adds a warm, youthful vibe to the room. Explore the generated world Use WASD keys to move Click and drag to look around Out of bounds We've given a few creators an early sneak peek at our technology to begin experimenting with the possibilities enabled by a D-native generative AI workflow. Eric Solorio shows how our models fill a gap in his creative workflow, making it easy to stage characters within scenes and direct precise camera movements: Brittani Natali lays out carefully crafted camera paths through our generated worlds to evoke different moods across three short films, using a workflow combining World Labs' technology with tools like Midjourney, Runway, Suno, ElevenLabs, Blender, and CapCut: Looking Ahead These results are our first early preview of generating D worlds. We are hard at work improving the size and fidelity of our generated worlds, and experimenting with new ways for users to interact with them.

, View Sora overview We explore large-scale training of generative models on video data. Specifically, we train text-conditional diffusion models jointly on videos and images of variable durations, resolutions and aspect ratios. We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity video. Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI : / : This technical report focuses on () our method for turning visual data of all types into a unified representation that enables large- scale training of generative models, and () qualitative evaluation of Soras capabilities and limitations. Model and implementation details are not included in this report. Much prior work has studied generative modeling of video data using a variety of methods, including recurrent networks, , , generative adversarial networks, , , , autoregressive transformers, , and diffusion models. , , These works often focus on a narrow category of visual data, on shorter videos, or on videos of a fixed size. Sora is a generalist model of visual datait can generate videos and images spanning diverse durations, aspect ratios and resolutions, up to a full minute of high definition video. Turning visual data into patches The We take inspiration from large language models which acquire generalist capabilities by training on internet-scale data. success of the LLM paradigm is enabled in part by the use of tokens that elegantly unify diverse modalities of textcode, math , and various natural languages. In this work, we consider how generative models of visual data can inherit such benefits. Whereas LLMs have text tokens, Sora has visual patches. Patches have previously been shown to be an effective representation for models of visual data. , , , We find that patches are a highly-scalable and effective representation for training generative models on diverse types of videos and images. At a high level, we turn videos into patches by first compressing videos into a lower-dimensional latent space, and subsequently decomposing the representation into spacetime patches. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI Video compression network We train a network that reduces the dimensionality of visual data. representation that is compressed both temporally and spatially. Sora is trained on and subsequently generates videos within this This network takes raw video as input and outputs a latent compressed latent space. We also train a corresponding decoder model that maps generated latents back to pixel space. Spacetime latent patches Given a compressed input video, we extract a sequence of spacetime patches which act as transformer tokens. This scheme works for images too since images are just videos with a single frame. Our patch-based representation enables Sora to train on videos and images of variable resolutions, durations and aspect ratios. At inference time, we can control the size of generated videos by arranging randomly-initialized patches in an appropriately-sized grid. Scaling transformers for video generation Sora is a diffusion model , , , , ; given input noisy patches (and conditioning information like text prompts), its trained to predict the original clean patches. Importantly, Sora is a diffusion transformer. Transformers have demonstrated remarkable scaling properties across a variety of domains, including language modeling, , computer vision, , , , and image generation. , , In this work, we find that diffusion transformers scale effectively as video models as well. Below, we show a comparison of video samples with fixed seeds and inputs as training progresses. Sample quality improves markedly as training compute increases. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI Base compute https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI x compute https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI x compute Variable durations, resolutions, aspect ratios Past approaches to image and video generation typically resize, crop or trim videos to a standard sizee.g., second videos at resolution. We find that instead training on data at its native size provides several benefits. Sampling flexibility Sora can sample widescreen p videos, vertical videos and everything inbetween. This lets Sora create content for different devices directly at their native aspect ratios. It also lets us quickly prototype content at lower sizes before generating at full resolutionall with the same model. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI Improved framing and composition We empirically find that training on videos at their native aspect ratios improves composition and framing. We compare Sora against a version of our model that crops all training videos to be square, which is common practice when training generative models. The modeltrained on square crops (left) sometimes generates videos where the subject is only partially in view. In comparison, videos from Sora (right) have improved framing. : / : https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI : / : Language understanding Training text-to-video generation systems requires a large amount of videos with corresponding text captions. We apply the re- captioning technique introduced in DALLE to videos. We first train a highly descriptive captioner model and then use it to produce text captions for all videos in our training set. We find that training on highly descriptive video captions improves text fidelity as well as the overall quality of videos. Similar to DALLE , we also leverage GPT to turn short user prompts into longer detailed captions that are sent to the video model. This enables Sora to generate high quality videos that accurately follow user prompts. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI a toy robot wearing a green dress and a sun hat taking a pleasant stroll in Johannesburg, South Africa during a winter storm Prompting with images and videos All of the results above and in our landing page show text-to-video samples. But Sora can also be prompted with other inputs, such as pre-existing images or video. This capability enables Sora to perform a wide range of image and video editing taskscreating perfectly looping video, animating static images, extending videos forwards or backwards in time, etc. Animating DALLE images Sora is capable of generating videos provided an image and prompt as input.

Below are three videos that were all extended backward in time starting from a segment of a generated video. As a result, each of the three videos starts different from the others, yet all three videos lead to the same ending. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI We can use this method to extend a video both forward and backward to produce a seamless infinite loop. : / : Video-to-video editing Diffusion models have enabled a plethora of methods for editing images and videos from text prompts.

Emerging simulation capabilities We find that video models exhibit a number of interesting emergent capabilities when trained at scale. These capabilities enable Sora to simulate some aspects of people, animals and environments from the physical world. These properties emerge without any explicit inductive biases for D, objects, etc.they are purely phenomena of scale. D consistency. Sora can generate videos with dynamic camera motion.

A significant challenge for video generation systems has been maintaining temporal consistency when sampling long videos. We find that Sora is often, though not always, able to effectively model both short- and long-range dependencies. For example, our model can persist people, animals and objects even when they are occluded or leave the frame. Likewise, it can generate multiple shots of the same character in a single sample, maintaining their appearance throughout the video. https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/ / //, : Video generation models as world simulators | OpenAI : / : : / : Interacting with the world.

genmo.ai/blog About Blog Careers Develop Playground Mochi : A new SOTA in open-source video generation models Mochi preview is an open state-of-the-art video generation model with high- fidelity motion and strong prompt adherence. Our new model dramatically closes the gap between closed and open video generation systems. We're releasing the model under a permissive Apache . license. Download the weights now or try this preview version for free on our playground. Introduction We are thrilled to announce a research preview of Mochi , our latest open-source video generation model. Mochi demonstrates dramatic improvements in quality of motion as well as extremely strong prompt adherence. Licensed under the Apache . license, a preview of Mochi is freely available for personal and commercial use. In addition to the model release, we're excited to unveil our hosted playground, where you can try Mochi for free today at genmo.ai/play. The weights and https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog architecture for Mochi are open and available on HuggingFace. Today, we are About releasing our p base model, with Mochi HD coming later this year. Careers Blog We're also pleased to share that Genmo has raised a $. million Series A funding round led by NEA led by Rick Yang with participation from The House Fund, Gold House Ventures, WndrCo, Eastlink Capital Partners, and Essence VC, as well as angel investors Abhay Parasnis (CEO of Typespace), Amjad Masad (CEO of Replit), Sabrina Hahn, Bonita Stewart, and Michele Catasta. At Genmo, our mission is to unlock the right brain of artificial general intelligence. Mochi is the first step toward building world simulators that can imagine anything, whether possible or impossible. Our team includes core members of projects like DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models), DreamFusion, and Emu Video. Genmo is advised by leading technical experts, including Ion Stoica (Executive Chairman and co-founder of Databricks and Anyscale), Pieter Abbeel (co-founder of Covariant and early team at OpenAI), and Joey Gonzalez (pioneer in language model systems and co- founder of Turi). Evaluations Today, there is an enormous gap between video generation models and reality. Motion quality and prompt adherence are two of the most critical capabilities that are still missing from video generation models. Mochi sets a new best-in-class standard for open-source video generation. It also performs very competitively with the leading closed models. Specifically, our p preview has strong: Prompt Adherence: Demonstrates exceptional alignment with textual prompts, ensuring that generated videos accurately reflect the given instructions. This allows users detailed control over characters, settings and actions. We benchmark prompt adherence with an automated metric using a vision language model as a judge following the protocol in OpenAI DALL-E . We evaluate generated videos using Gemini-.-Pro-. Motion Quality: Mochi generates smooth videos at frames per second for durations up to . seconds, with high temporal coherence and realistic motion https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog dynamics. Mochi simulates physics like fluid dynamics, fur and hair simulation, and expresses consistent, fluid human action that is beginning to cross the About Blog Careers uncanny valley. Raters were instructed to focus on motion rather than frame- level aesthetics (criteria include interestingness of the motion, physical plausibility, and fluidity). Elo scores are computed following the LMSYS Chatbot Arena protocol. Prompt Adherence Measures how accurately generated videos follow the provided textual instructions, ensuring high fidelity to user intent. Elo Score Evaluates both motion smoothness and spatial realism, ensuring that generated videos are fluid and visually captivating. https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog About Blog Careers Limitations Under the research preview, Mochi is a living and evolving checkpoint. There are a few known limitations. The initial release generates videos at p today. In some edge cases with extreme motion, minor warping and distortions can also occur. Mochi is also optimized for photorealistic styles so does not perform well with animated content. We also anticipate that the community will fine-tune the model to suit various aesthetic preferences. Additionally, we have implemented robust safety moderation protocols in the playground to ensure that all video generations remain safe and aligned with ethical guidelines. Model Architecture Mochi represents a significant advancement in open-source video generation, featuring a billion parameter diffusion model built on our novel Asymmetric Diffusion Transformer (AsymmDiT) architecture. Trained entirely from scratch, it is the largest video generative model ever openly released. And best of all, its a simple, hackable architecture. Efficiency is critical to ensure the community can run our models. Alongside Mochi, we are open-sourcing our video VAE. Our VAE causally compresses https://www.genmo.ai/blog / //, : genmo.ai/blog videos to a x smaller size, with an x spatial and a x temporal compression to a -channel latent space. About Blog Careers An AsymmDiT efficiently processes user prompts alongside compressed video tokens by streamlining text processing and focusing neural network capacity on visual reasoning. AsymmDiT jointly attends to text and visual tokens with multi- modal self-attention and learns separate MLP layers for each modality, similar to Stable Diffusion . However, our visual stream has nearly times as many parameters as the text stream via a larger hidden dimension. To unify the modalities in self-attention, we use non-square QKV and output projection layers. This asymmetric design reduces inference memory requirements. Many modern diffusion models use multiple pretrained language models to represent user prompts. In contrast, Mochi simply encodes prompts with a single T-XXL language model. Mochi jointly reasons over a context window of , video tokens with full D attention. To localize each token, we extend learnable rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) to -dimensions. The network end-to-end learns mixing frequencies for space and time axes. Mochi benefits from some of the latest improvements in language model scaling including SwiGLU feedforward layers, query-key normalization for enhanced stability, and sandwich normalization to control internal activations. A technical paper will follow with additional details to encourage progress in video generation. Open-Source Release We are releasing Mochi under the Apache . license. Its critical that there is an open research ecosystem around video generation. We believe that open-source models drive progress and democratize access to state-of-the-art AI capabilities.

Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind evaluating embodied agents. Based on a single prompt image, it can be played by a human or AI agent using keyboard and mouse inputs. DeepMind Games play a key role in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Their engaging nature, unique blend of challenges, and measurable progress make them ideal environments to safely test and advance AI capabilities. Indeed, games have been important to Google DeepMind since our founding. From our early work with Atari games, breakthroughs such as AlphaGo and AlphaStar, to our research on generalist agents in collaboration with game developers, games have been center stage in our research. However, training more general embodied agents has been traditionally bottlenecked by the availability of sufficiently rich and diverse training environments. As we show, Genie could enable future agents to be trained and evaluated in a limitless curriculum of novel worlds. Our research also paves the way for new, creative workflows for prototyping interactive experiences. Emergent capabilities of a foundation world model https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind Until now, world models have largely been confined to modeling narrow domains. In Genie , we introduced an approach for generating a diverse array of D worlds. DeepMind Today we introduce Genie , which represents a significant leap forward in generality. Genie can generate a vast diversity of rich D worlds. Genie is a world model, meaning it can simulate virtual worlds, including the consequences of taking any action (e.g. jump, swim, etc.). It was trained on a large- scale video dataset and, like other generative models, demonstrates various emergent capabilities at scale, such as object interactions, complex character animation, physics, and the ability to model and thus predict the behavior of other agents. Below are example videos of people interacting with Genie . For every example, the model is prompted with a single image generated by Imagen , GDMs state-of- the-art text-to-image model. This means anyone can describe a world they want in text, select their favorite rendering of that idea, and then step into and interact with that newly created world (or have an AI agent be trained or evaluated in it). At each step, a person or agent provides a keyboard and mouse action, and Genie simulates the next observation. Genie can generate consistent worlds for up to a minute, with the majority of examples shown lasting -s. Action controls Genie responds intelligently to actions taken by pressing keys on a keyboard, identifying the character and moving it correctly. For example, our model has to figure out that arrow keys should move the robot and not the trees or clouds.

Generating counterfactuals We can generate diverse trajectories from the same starting frame, which means it is possible to simulate counterfactual experiences for training agents. In each row, each video starts from the same frame, but has different actions taken by a human player. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Long horizon memory Genie is capable of remembering parts of the world that are no longer in view and then rendering them accurately when they become observable again.

Playing from real world images Genie can also be prompted with real world images, where we see that it can model grass blowing in the wind or water flowing in a river. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Genie prompted with real world photos. Genie enables rapid prototyping Genie makes it easy to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences, enabling researchers to quickly experiment with novel environments to train and test embodied AI agents. For example, below we prompt Genie with different images generated by Imagen to model the difference between flying a paper plane, a dragon, a hawk, or a parachute and test how well Genie can animate different avatars. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Genie can be used to rapidly prototype diverse interactive experiences. Thanks to Genie 's out-of-distribution generalization capabilities, concept art and drawings can be turned into fully interactive environments. This enables artists and designers to prototype quickly, which can bootstrap the creative process for environment design, further accelerating research. Here we show examples of research environment concepts made by our concept artist. Environment concept by Max Cant Genie Environment concept by Max Cant Genie AI agents acting inside the world model https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind By using Genie to quickly create rich and diverse environments for AI agents, our researchers can also generate evaluation tasks that agents have not seen during training. Below, we show examples of a SIMA agent that we developed in DeepMind collaboration with games developers, following instructions on unseen environments synthesized by Genie via a single image prompt. Image generated by Imagen Prompt: \"A screenshot of a third-person open world exploration game. The player is an adventurer exploring a forest. There is a house with a red door on the left, and a house with a blue door on the right. The camera is placed directly behind the player. #photorealistic #immersive\" The SIMA agent is designed to complete tasks in a range of D game worlds by following natural-language instructions. Here we used Genie to generate a D environment with two doors, a blue and a red one, and provided instructions to the SIMA agent to open each of them. In this example, SIMA is controlling the avatar via keyboard and mouse inputs, while Genie generates the game frames. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Prompt Open the blue door Prompt Open the red door We can also use SIMA to help evaluate Genie s capabilities. Here we test Genie s ability to generate consistent environments by instructing SIMA to look around and explore behind the house. Prompt Turn around Prompt Go behind the house While this research is still in its early stage with substantial room for improvement on both agent and environment generation capabilities, we believe Genie is the path to solving a structural problem of training embodied agents safely while achieving the breadth and generality required to progress towards AGI. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Image generated by Imagen Prompt: \"An image of a computer game showing a scene from inside a rough hewn stone cave or mine. The viewer's position is a rd person camera based above a player avatar looking down towards the avatar. The player avatar is a knight with a sword. In front of the knight avatar there are x stone arched doorways and the knight chooses to go through any one of these doors. Beyond the first and inside we can see strange green plants with glowing flowers lining that tunnel. Inside and beyond the second doorway there is a corridor of spiked iron plates riveted to the cave walls leading towards an ominous glow further along. Through the third door we can see a set of rough hewn stone steps ascending to a mysterious destination.\" Prompt Go up the stairs Prompt Go where the plants are https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Prompt Go to the middle door Diffusion world model Genie is an autoregressive latent diffusion model, trained on a large video dataset. After passing through an autoencoder, latent frames from the video are passed to a large transformer dynamics model, trained with a causal mask similar to that used by large language models. At inference time, Genie can be sampled in an autoregressive fashion, taking individual actions and past latent frames on a frame-by-frame basis. We use classifier-free guidance to improve action controllability. The samples in this blog post are generated by an undistilled base model, to show what is possible. We can play a distilled version in real-time with a reduction in quality of the outputs. https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie--a-large-scale-foundation-world-model/ / //, : Genie : A large-scale foundation world model - Google DeepMind DeepMind Developing our technologies responsibly Genie shows the potential of foundational world models for creating diverse D environments and accelerating agent research. This research direction is in its early stages and we look forward to continuing to improve Genies world generation capabilities in terms of generality and consistency. As with SIMA, our research is building towards more general AI systems and agents that can understand and safely carry out a wide range of tasks in a way that is helpful to people online and in the real world.

[dev], weights are available on Hugging Face and inference code can be found on GitHub and in HuggingFaces Diusers. Moreover were happy to have day- integration for ComfyUI. Transformer-powered Flow Models at Scale All public FLUX. models are based on a hybrid architecture of multimodal and parallel diusion transformer blocks and scaled to B parameters. We improve over previous state-of-the-art diusion models by building on ow matching, a general and conceptually simple method for training generative models, which includes diusion as a special case. In addition, we increase model performance and improve hardware eciency by incorporating rotary positional embeddings and parallel attention layers. We will publish a more detailed tech report in the near future. A new Benchmark for Image Synthesis FLUX. denes the new state-of-the-art in image synthesis. Our models set new standards in their respective model class. FLUX. [pro] and [dev] surpass popular models like Midjourney v., DALLE (HD) and SD-Ultra in each of the following aspects: Visual Quality, Prompt Following, Size/Aspect Variability, Typography and Output Diversity.
